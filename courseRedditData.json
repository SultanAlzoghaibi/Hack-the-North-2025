Of course, you\u2019re going to mature your skills later on and build confidence. However, it\u2019s  hard to say what you really want in terms of CPSC because it\u2019s so vast but maybe you might be interested in specific areas of computer science. \n\nIf coding might not be for you or if you begin to doubt your passion, then probably take some classes that interest you while taking cpsc, talk to an advisor, or even try a semester with little cpsc involved to actually see if you really enjoy coding. \n\nGood luck!",

The changes are motivated by the fact that many of you were not able to get a seat in the course when you needed to take the course.  To try to fix this we:\n\n* made more seats available in a course in the semester that students most commonly take the course (and that allows for completion of the degree in time).  This did mean that we could not offer courses in both Fall and Winter semesters anymore.  To adjust for this, all required courses will be offered during the Spring semester, starting in Spring 2018.\n\n* reserved seats for students that need it.  In the required courses, all seats are held until August for students that need the course to complete their degree.  In courses that are required for a concentration, a portion of the seats are held for those that have the concentration declared.  Note that these are only held until the middle of April.\n\nIf a course is full and you have trouble registering in the course that you need for your \n\na) degree, contact the department before August 2018;\n\nb) concentration, contact the department before April 15 2018.\n\nOne final note: all SENG courses are open to Computer Science students.  SENG 401 and 437 are offered by the Faculty of Engineering next year.  Computer Science students have to manually be added to the list of students that are allowed to take the course.  If you wish to take either of these two courses, contact USC and they will add you to the list of students allowed to register in the course.\n\nBest wishes",

We only started offering courses in Spring a few years ago with the influx of transfers to our program.\n \nCPSC 219 is the follow on for CPSC 217 and since it is not for our majors it is only ever offered in Winter.\n \nCPSC 235 is no longer offered and hasn\u2019t been on our books for a few years now.\n \nUnfortunately if we do not have an instructor to teach a course we cannot run it, and for Fall that means we cannot offer 233.\n \nThanks,\u201d\n\n- Catherine Cummings, Undergraduate Coordinator & Administrative Assistant \n\nThe response I got after requesting further information on the matter. \n\nLogistically, I hope the department understands that this makes *absolutely no sense*. Why are you offering 231 in spring if the course following it is not offered until Winter? Taking 231 in spring is completely useless now. They need to either hire a temporary instructor, or remove a course so 233 is offered, or don\u2019t offer 231 in spring. ",

There's nothing else that'll teach you, other than maybe some TAs doing a review on languages for people unfamiliar. \n\nI'd highly recommend, if you want to stay current, just keep practicing. Come up with an idea for a program that you'd be interested in making. Fork repos from git and poke around, see if you can write something to contribute. Just stay working on a project. \n\nOf course, I always feel coding is like riding a bike, where you may temporarily forget, but it'll always come back to you. With that, I wouldn't be too worried about taking a semester break, but you might be different from me. \n\nThe one other thing, most of my course choices were geared towards my degree requirement and I never took anything like advanced programming, so you may have some luck there.

Instead of teaching you the exact syntax of a certain language. So if you would like to further learning about java. There are practices online. Maybe join a club (problem solving club). Or even do a little project on your own using java. There are a lot of ways to learn a language. Learning from a course is not the only way to better one self. ",

Secondly, there's just not enough new material you could learn in Java to constitute making a course, and most of the more recent additions to the language (generics, lambdas etc) are things that you can pick up yourself fairly easily by using online tutorials and documentation.",
